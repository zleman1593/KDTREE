# KDTREE

This program builds a 2D kd-tree for a set of random points, renders it in 2D with default orthogonal projection, and uses the tree to draw something that looks like a Mondrian painting.

Compile with command:
make -f Makefile.txt

Run with command: ./viewPoints n

where n is the number of points you want to 

Once the program is running the following commands can be used to interact with the program:

0-5: Pressing these keys will show a test case

SPACEBAR: Will make a new tree based off of n random new points

p: Will hide and show the individual points
